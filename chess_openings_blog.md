# Chess Openings: How often they are played and what are their success rates?

I am a chess player. I used to play a lot but when I was younger but then lost
contact to the game due to lack of playing partners. A couple of
years ago I discovered [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org) and got back into playing. This
re-boosted my playing level and so I thought I use their free data
for this data science project on chess openings.

[Lichess.org](https://lichess.org) is a free online chess server that provides an extensive
data set on all games that have been played between Jan 2013 until
today at the [Lichess.org open database](https://database.lichess.org/). At the time of writing, this
data comprises almost 1.5TB.

Lichess data provides information about the players' skill (in terms of their ELO points), the result
of the game and, most importantly for the purposes of this article, the opening that was played. I ran
a data science study and investigated three key question.

# Introduction

Lichess free data is in PGN format. It provides metadata on the games,
the moves made in the games plus timing and scoring information. It
is tailored for chess engines to replay and analyze games. I was interested only
in the matadata.
